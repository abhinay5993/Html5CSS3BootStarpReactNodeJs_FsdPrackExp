                        HTML5 is the latest standard of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes the structure
                        and presentation of web pages. It's made up of three codes: HTML, which keeps the structure;
                        CSS, which affects the presentation; and JavaScript, which creates interactive effects within
                        web browsers.

                        CSS3, also known as Cascading Style Sheets Level 3, is a more advanced version of CSS and the
                        successor of CSS2. CSS3 is used for the same thing as CSS, namely to style web pages and make
                        them more attractive and user-friendly.

                        TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset
                        of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for
                        development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. Because TypeScript is a superset
                        of JavaScript, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript programs. However,
                        TypeScript programs must pass type checking before they can be compiled into JavaScript.
