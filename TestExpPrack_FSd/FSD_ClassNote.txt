Bank database :
Consider the following database maintained by a Bank. The Bank maintains information 
about its branches, customers and their loan applications. 
Following are the tables: 
BRANCH (BID INTEGER, BRNAME CHAR (30), BRCITY CHAR (10)) 
CUSTOMER (CNO INTEGER, CNAME CHAR (20), CADDR CHAR (35), CITY (20)) 
LOAN_APPLICATION (LNO INTEGER, LAMTREQUIRED MONEY, LAMTAPPROVED 
MONEY, L_DATE DATE) 
The relationship is as follows: 
BRANCH, CUSTOMER, LOAN_APPLICATION are related with ternary relationship. 
TERNARY (BID INTEGER, CNO INTEGER, LNO INTEGER).

Look for the Query:
====================
1. Select cname from customer, branch, ternary where customer.cid=ternary.cid and branch.bid=ternary.bid and br_name=”Pune”;
2. List the names of the customers who have received loan less than their requirement.
3. Find the maximum loan amount approved
4. Find out the total loan amount sanctioned by “Deccan “branch. 
5. Count the number of loan applications received by “M.G.ROAD” branch. 
6. List the names of the customer along with the branch names who have applied for loan 
in the month of September.

=====
Find the names of the customers for the “-------” branch.
select cname,bname from customer,branch,loan,ternary
where customer.cid=ternary.cid and branch.bid=ternary.bid and loan.lid=ternary.lid 
and loan.l_date like "____-05-__";

=====
SELECT customer.CNAME, branch.BRNAME
FROM customer, branch, ternary, loan_application
WHERE branch.BID = ternary.BID
AND ternary.CNO = customer.CNO
AND ternary.LNO = loan_application.LNO
AND MONTH(loan_application.L_DATE) = 9;
